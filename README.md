# polygons
Final Object Orientated C++ Project

A small project for my final univeristy coursework in Object Orientated C++ to allow the generation and manipulation of polygons using only the standard library.
Originally created in Xcode - Ported to Visual Studio for submission, with a few windows only features added at the end.

Features include:
Full mainpulation of shapes, from scaling and translating to rotation using user defined matrices.

Full back button intergration

Load and save to file system

A collision detection feature - Currently lists the coordinate positions at which an overlap exists between newly created shape and any existing shapes.

Also included is an example save file with a selection of shapes, coordinates and matrices saved.
